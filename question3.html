	<h1 style="color: red;"> As you can see . In the first line it is clearly defined the value of x is 500. because in js file code i have assigned the value of x is 500(var x = "500";). </h1>
	<h1 style="color: blue;"> In this Second line . i have declared a variable y(var y;) in the js code but i have not assigned any valur to this variable(y). so that , it is giving the term "undefined" in the statement</h1>
	<h1>In this third line , i have not declared the variable "anuj" in the js file code but tried to print(console.log(+anuj);) the value of "anuj". so it is showing that "anuj" is not defined." </h1>
