	<h3>in this html code i have linked a js file(To know about scopes of variables.) . To see it please right click your mouse on this page and then select the last option "inspect " and then in inspect click on console to see the output of linked js file.</h3>
	<h1>in that console page as you can see first it is written as "anuj" here anuj is in global but one more name is there "gopi" which is declared inside the function  {here both names "anuj" and "gopi are declared with one variable only(var a). "anuj" is declared globally and "gopi is declared in a function(inside function bani)."} . so when we are calling the function(function bani) then only it is printing "gopi" and all other time it is printing anuj only. </h1>
